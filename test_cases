ðŸ§ª Test cases for manual checking

Hereâ€™s a table of simple test inputs you can apply and what the output should be:

TPS (V)	Brake	Expected BSPD Output
0.2 V	OFF	OK (no trip, valid low TPS)
0.2 V	ON	OK (no trip, TPS <10%)
1.0 V	OFF	OK (TPS >10%, but no brake)
1.0 V	ON	Trip after 1 s (BSPD should latch)
4.2 V	ON	Trip after 1 s (TPS >10%, brake ON)
5.0 V	Any	Immediate trip (out of range)
0.0 V	Any	Immediate trip (out of range)
TPS wire disconnected	Any	Immediate trip (<100 ms)
Power loss	Any	Immediate trip (relay de-energizes)
